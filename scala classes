###After overriding

class departments(var departmentid: Int, var  departmentname: String){
     | println("departmendid is " + departmentid + " and departmentsname is " +  departmentname) 
     | override def toString = "departments(" + departmentid + ", " + departmentname + ")"
     | }
     
     
     
val d = new departments(1, "fan shop")
departmendid is 1 and departmentsname is fan shop
======> d: departments = departments(1, fan shop)
